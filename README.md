## Node script for converting soap requests/responses to CSV

This isn't supposed to be used for public use due to the bespoke nature of destructing the json/xml. Your xml files will be strucutred differently
Also it isn't the most efficient or clean code but it did the job in converting a thousand xml files to csv in rouhgly 10 seconds
